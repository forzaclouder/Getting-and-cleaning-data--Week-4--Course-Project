Hi Dear reviewer!

This repository is for Getting and Cleaning Data course project created by Yunke Li in 2019/4. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You could:
1:Check the finaldata.txt using read.table("finaldata.txt",header=T)
2:Chenk ther un_analysis.R, it will automaticlly download dataset and tidy it

CodeBook introduce the idea of my code and description of variant(actually i don't know what those means so i leave it with its name :p)

Thank you!
