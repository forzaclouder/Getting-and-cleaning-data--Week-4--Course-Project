Hi!

The row data set is from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Run the run_analysis.R and the final data will be store as FinalData.txt.
It should countain 180 rows and 68 columns.

1st column is Subject ID
2nd column is the type of activity performed by subject and it has 6 value:
  WALKING
  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  SITTING
  STANDING
  LAYING
From colum3-column68 are different variant including:
